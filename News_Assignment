<h1>Bo Jon's Flower and Gifts Second Year Anniversary</h1>
  <h2>Celebrate Their Second Anniversary On May 11</h2>
    <p>Bo Jonâ€™s Flowers has been open since 1969, but has switched ownership 4 times. The latest owners, Jeff and Erin Powers, bought the business back in 2022 on May 2. Since then, the new owners have altered the business's products and services. For instance, instead of selling decor and silk florals, they have switched gears to selling rare and tropical houseplants that you won't find anywhere else. They also have started selling gourmet chocolates from vendors across the U.S. They even introduced a wide selection of wine and beer back in February of 2023! </p>
   <p>Erin Powers explains, <q>We wanted to keep Bo Jon's reputation for selling quality and artistic floral designs, but switch up the gift options we offer.</q>On February 10th, they had multiple pop ups from several vendors including Eagle Eye Farm, White Pine Berry Farm, and Urban Hippie Homestead. Since then, Bo Jon's now offers those vendors' products in store and on their website including Eagle Eye Farm's specialty honey,sheep's milk soap, and other cosmetic products along with White Pine Berry Farm's jams, jellies and fudge!<p>
